## What is Reuser?

Reuser is an open source platform build by developers to provide people with an easy way to give away items that they don't want anymore.
This is to help reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfill every year and also help people living in poverty that are in need of items that they simply can't afford.

This service is designed to always be free, Built by people for people and solving some major global issues to with recycling. 

More to be added later... Work in progress.

//When

## When

__Reuser__ is still in early Alpha stage so until there is a solid skeleton developed, contribution to source code is limited. However if your really keen to have your input or have some advice around technologies that we are using feel free to contact the team on slack.  

//Why

## Why Build Reuser?

Around the world waste managment is a massive issue, the impact this has on the enviroment differs between country to courntry. But with over 2.5 Million tonnes of waste sent to landfill every year in New Zealand alone this is something that we can relate to easily. Combine this with a stagering 29% child poverty rate in 2016, this means that 1 in every 4 children struggle to meet the daily living requirements. 

Reuser targets both problems at once by providing an easy to use platform for people to easily give away items that they no longer need and also providing a place for people living in poverty to find items they require.
